Here is the first bullet list.

  - Item 0.

  - Item 1.

  - Item 2.

Here is the second bullet list.  This contains multiline items, which are
indentent.

  - Item 0.  

  - Item 1.  This is a very long item.  It extends past the first line and into
    the second line.

  - Item 2.  This is another long item.  It, too, extends past the first line 
    and into the second line.  Unlike the previous item, it goes on and on and
    event makes it to the third line.

Here is the third bullet list.  This contains multiline items, which are
not indentent.

  - Item 0.  

  - Item 1.  This is a very long item.  It extends past the first line and into
  the second line.

  - Item 2.  This is another long item.  It, too, extends past the first line 
  and into the second line.  Unlike the previous item, it goes on and on and
  event makes it to the third line.

Here is the fourth bullet list.  It's like the second but the items are not
indented.

- Item 0.  

- Item 1.  This is a very long item.  It extends past the first line and into
  the second line.

- Item 2.  This is another long item.  It, too, extends past the first line 
  and into the second line.  Unlike the previous item, it goes on and on and
  event makes it to the third line.

Here is the fifth bullet list.  It's like the third but the items are a whole
are not indented.

- Item 0.  

- Item 1.  This is a very long item.  It extends past the first line and into
the second line.

- Item 2.  This is another long item.  It, too, extends past the first line 
and into the second line.  Unlike the previous item, it goes on and on and
event makes it to the third line.

Here is the sixth bullet list.  It's like the second but without newlines.
  - Item 0.  
  - Item 1.  This is a very long item.  It extends past the first line and into
    the second line.
  - Item 2.  This is another long item.  It, too, extends past the first line 
    and into the second line.  Unlike the previous item, it goes on and on and
    event makes it to the third line.
Here is the seventh bullet list.  It's like the sixth but not subsequent lines
not indented.
  - Item 0.  
  - Item 1.  This is a very long item.  It extends past the first line and into
  the second line.
  - Item 2.  This is another long item.  It, too, extends past the first line 
  and into the second line.  Unlike the previous item, it goes on and on and
  event makes it to the third line.

  Is this part of item2?  Not sure.  Probably not.
Here is the eight.  It's like the sixth but no overall indentation.
- Item 0.  
- Item 1.  This is a very long item.  It extends past the first line and into
  the second line.
- Item 2.  This is another long item.  It, too, extends past the first line 
  and into the second line.  Unlike the previous item, it goes on and on and
  event makes it to the third line.
And finally, the ninth, which removes the item indentation.
- Item 0.  
- Item 1.  This is a very long item.  It extends past the first line and into
the second line.
- Item 2.  This is another long item.  It, too, extends past the first line 
and into the second line.  Unlike the previous item, it goes on and on and
event makes it to the third line.
In this case I have no idea how to tell that the last item is finished.

This line is definitely not in a bullet list.

Here is a nested bullet list.

- Level 0 item 0
- Level 0 item 1 blahblahblahblah blahblahblahblah blahblahblahblah 
  blahblahblahblah blahblahblahblah
  - Level 1 item 0
  - Level 1 item 1 blahblahblahblah blahblahblahblah blahblahblahblah
  blahblahblahblah blahblahblahblah
  - Level 1 item 2
- Level 0 item 2
- Level 0 item 3
  - Level 1b item 0
    - Level 2 item 0
  - Level 1b item 1
