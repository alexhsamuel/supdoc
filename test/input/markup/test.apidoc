    Python API documentation extraction and browsing.

    This package extracts information about objects in Python source code, such
    as classes and functions.  This information is represented as a JSON
    document, which can be served to a web API for browsing.

    Finding modules
    ---------------

    Use 'apidoc.modules' to obtain information about modules in a package
    hierarchy.  

      >>> import apidoc.modules
      >>> names = apidoc.modules.find_modules(path)

    The 'find_modules()' function generates the list of /fully-qualified module
    names/ below 'path', which is assumed to be at the top level of the
    'PYTHONPATH'.
